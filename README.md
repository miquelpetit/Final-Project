## Project Description
Write a short description of your project: 3-5 sentences about what your project is about, why you chose this topic (if relevant), and what you are trying to show. 

<a name="hypotheses-/-questions"></a>

## Hypotheses / Questions
* What data/business/research/personal question you would like to answer? 
* What is he context for the question and the scientific or business application? 
* What are the hypotheses you would like to test in order to answer your question?  
Frame your hypothesis with statistical/data languages (i.e. define Null and Alternative Hypothesis). You can use formulas if you want but that is not required.

<a name="dataset"></a>

## Dataset
* Where did you get your data? If you downloaded a dataset (either public or private), describe where you downloaded it and include the command to load the dataset.
* Did you build your own datset? If so, did you use an API? If so, provide the scripts in your repo.
* For all types of datasets, provide a description of the size, complexity, and data types included in your dataset, as well as a schema of the tables if necessary.
* If the question cannot be answered with the available data, why not? What data would you need to answer it better?

<a name="cleaning"></a>

## Cleaning
Describe your full process of data wrangling and cleaning. Document why you chose to fill missing values, extract outliers, or create the variables you did, etc, as well as your thinking process.

<a name="analysis"></a>

## Analysis
* Overview the general steps you will go through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.
* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Include charts to demonstrate the effect of your work. 
* If you use ML in your final project, describe your feature selection process.

<a name="model-training-and-evaluation"></a>

## Model Training and Evaluation
*Include this section only if you chose to include ML in your project.*
* Describe how you trained your model, the results you obtained, and how you evaluated those results.

<a name="conclusion"></a>

## Conclusion
* Summarize your results. What do they mean?
* What can you say about your hypotheses?
* Interpret your findings in terms of the human-understandable question you try to answer.

<a name="future-work"></a>

## Future Work
Address any questions you were unable to answer, or any next steps or future extensions to your project.

<a name="workflow"></a>

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What were the steps?
How will you test the success of our analysis or algorithm?

<a name="organization"></a>

## Organization
How did you organize yourself? Did you use any tools?
